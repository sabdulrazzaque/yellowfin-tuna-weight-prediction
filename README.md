## How It Works

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans the dataset.
   - Encodes categorical variables and scales numerical ones.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Trains multiple models using `train_and_evaluate_pipeline.py`.
   - Performs hyperparameter optimization.
   - Saves the best model.

3. **Testing**:
   - Tests the best model on unseen data using `test_best_model.py`.
   - Generates evaluation metrics.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Exposes a REST API for predictions using Flask (`model_api.py`).
   - Accepts JSON inputs and returns predictions.

5. **Web Interface**:
   - User-friendly form to input data and view predictions.
   - Communicates with the Flask API in real-time.

## Benchmarks and Performance

Performance metrics for trained models:

| Model          | RÂ²    | MAE    | RMSE   | MAPE   |
|-----------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Random Forest   | 0.92  | 3.45   | 4.56   | 12.3%  |
| XGBoost         | 0.93  | 3.20   | 4.21   | 11.8%  |
| LightGBM        | 0.91  | 3.60   | 4.70   | 12.5%  |
| CatBoost        | 0.94  | 3.10   | 4.00   | 11.5%  |

**Best performing model**: **CatBoost**

## Test Cases

### Example 1: Typical Gillnet Fishing Scenario
- **Input**:
  - Fishing Method: Gillnet
  - Length Frequency Species 1 (cm): 50
  - Year: 2025
  - Month: 5
  - Day: 20
  - Total Number: 500
  - Latitude: 10
  - Longitude: 75
- **Expected Result**:
  - `Log_Total_Number` auto-calculates to `6.216606`.
  - The model should predict a reasonable weight.

---

### Example 2: High Total Number with Purse Seine
- **Input**:
  - Fishing Method: Purse Seine
  - Length Frequency Species 1 (cm): 350
  - Year: 2030
  - Month: 12
  - Day: 31
  - Total Number: 10000
  - Latitude: -15
  - Longitude: 120
- **Expected Result**:
  - `Log_Total_Number` auto-calculates to `9.210440`.
  - Prediction should reflect a larger fish weight.

---

### Example 3: Minimal Values for Longline Fishing
- **Input**:
  - Fishing Method: Longline
  - Length Frequency Species 1 (cm): 0
  - Year: 2025
  - Month: 1
  - Day: 1
  - Total Number: 0
  - Latitude: 0
  - Longitude: 0
- **Expected Result**:
  - `Log_Total_Number` remains `0.000000`.
  - The model should handle zero inputs gracefully.

---

### Example 4: Edge Case - Latitude/Longitude Bounds
- **Input**:
  - Fishing Method: Gillnet
  - Length Frequency Species 1 (cm): 80
  - Year: 2024
  - Month: 7
  - Day: 10
  - Total Number: 200
  - Latitude: 90
  - Longitude: 180
- **Expected Result**:
  - `Log_Total_Number` auto-calculates to `5.303305`.
  - The system should validate that the latitude and longitude are within valid bounds and make a prediction.

---

### Example 5: Unrealistic Latitude/Longitude
- **Input**:
  - Fishing Method: Longline
  - Length Frequency Species 1 (cm): 75
  - Year: 2025
  - Month: 6
  - Day: 15
  - Total Number: 300
  - Latitude: 95
  - Longitude: 200
- **Expected Result**:
  - The server should respond with an error indicating that latitude and longitude are out of valid bounds.

---

### Example 6: Missing Inputs
- **Input**:
  - Fishing Method: Longline
  - Length Frequency Species 1 (cm): (Leave empty)
  - Year: 2025
  - Month: 5
  - Day: 20
  - Total Number: (Leave empty)
  - Latitude: 10
  - Longitude: 75
- **Expected Result**:
  - Missing inputs should default to `0.0` for numeric fields.
  - The server should still provide a prediction or error message based on the defaults.

## Steps to Test

1. Open the `form.html` file in a browser.
2. Enter the test inputs in the form fields.
3. Submit the form.
4. Observe the result displayed (or logged in the server logs).
5. Repeat with variations to ensure robustness.

## API Input/Output Example

### API Input Example:
Send a JSON payload to the `/predict` endpoint:
```json
{
  "Fishing_Method": "Gillnet",
  "Length_Frequency_Species1_cm": 45.0,
  "Year": 2023,
  "Month": 10,
  "Day": 5,
  "Total_Number": 120,
  "Latitude": -15.5,
  "Longitude": 150.2
}


## API Output Example

Here is an example of the API's JSON response:
```json
{
  "Prediction": "325.45 kg",
  "Feedback": "Log_Total_Number matches the logarithm of Total_Number."
}
```

## FAQs

**Q1:** Can this project be used for fish species other than Yellowfin Tuna?  
**A1:** The current model is trained specifically for Yellowfin Tuna. To adapt it for other species, you would need to retrain the model on a relevant dataset.

**Q2:** Why is the web form not working?  
**A2:** Ensure the API is running (`model_api.py`) and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

**Q3:** How do I deploy this project on the cloud?  
**A3:** You can use platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku. Start by containerizing the app using Docker.

## Known Issues/Limitations

- The model currently assumes the input data is well-formatted; unexpected formats may lead to errors.  
- Predictions may be less accurate for extreme outliers or missing features.  
- Web form input validation is basic and should be enhanced for production use.
